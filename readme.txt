NAME: Caesar-Cipher
SYNOPSIS: Create an encrypted message using the Caesar cipher method and also use the same program to decrypt it.
DESCRIPTION: This program is able to take the input that you have given it, choose the number of places you want the letters to shift by and encrypt the message into gibberish. The program is also able to decrypt the message by using negative numbers.

HOW TO USE: 
	Encryption:
		The program will ask the user for a message to encrypt. (You can put whatever characters you want in here as code 	will filter out what doesn’t fit.)
		Then the program will ask the user for the shift in order to make the encryption viable. E.g. “3” or "-3" 
		(ONLY put numbers in this field.)
		If you happen to put a full stop into the code, when you decipher it, it will show as an "X". So don't be alarmed to 	why you see a random X in your message.
		Then the out-put will be displayed. (This is the final output and your message will be encrypted.
 	Decryption:
		The program will ask the user for a message to encrypt, paste the encrypted message into this field. (You can put whatever characters you want in here as code will filter out what doesn’t fit.)
		With the shift, use negative numbers. E.g. “-3”
		The message will be decrypted and you will be able to read the message.
